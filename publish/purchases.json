        "question": "What is included in the KMP Starter Template?",
        "answer": "You get a production-ready Kotlin Multiplatform project with pre-configured Compose UI, Koin DI, RevenueCat Billing, and a robust startup orchestration system."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does it support both Android and iOS?",
        "answer": "Yes! The template is built for 100% shared logic across platforms, including shared UI using Compose Multiplatform for maximum code reuse."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use this for commercial projects?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Once you purchase a plan, you can use the template to launch your own apps on the Play Store and App Store without any hidden royalties."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get updates to the template?",
        "answer": "Premium members get access to our private repository where we regularly push updates for the latest Kotlin and Compose versions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is there support for integrating my own backend?",
        "answer": "Yes, the template is designed with a clean architecture (Repository pattern), making it easy to swap the mock data with your Firebase, Supabase, or Ktor backend."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the refund policy?",
        "answer": "We offer a 24-hour 'no questions asked' refund if the template doesn't meet your technical requirements."
