# KMP Starter Template

Starter Template is a project-agnostic, multi-module boilerplate based on KMP for Android & iOS, which includes high-quality written code for KMP/CMP projects. It is built with best practices and follows clean architecture principles.

It will help you cut the noise of setting up basic things such as remote config, in-app purchases, analytics, etc., and focus on building your app.

Each feature follows clean architecture with data, domain, and presentation layers. You can easily make changes in any layer. For example, for analytics it uses Mixpanel; if you want to swap it with PostHog, you can do it by just changing the analytics data source.

## Why I Made This

I was tired of writing the same code in all of my KMP projects, so I decided to make a boilerplate that would help me set up projects quickly and focus on building what truly matters. I didn’t have any plan to make it open source, but then I thought, why not share it with the community? There are a few templates available, but they are paid, costing around $100, and I thought that was too much for a starter template. So I decided to make a free and open-source starter template.
