# KMP Starter Template

Starter template is a project agnostic multi-module boilerplate based on KMP for Android & IOS, which includes high quaility written code for KMP/CMP projects. It is built with best practices and follows clean architecture principles.

it will help you cut the noise of setting up basic things such as remote config, in app purchases & analytics etc and focus on building your app.

## Features

- [x] Clean Architecture
- [x] Koin for dependency injection
- [x] RevenueCat for in-app purchases
- [x] Mixpanel for tracking user behavior
- [x] Firebase remote config for feature flags
- [x] InAppReview & InAppUpdate
- [x] Multiple Languages
- [x] Swift to Kotlin using SPM4KMP Plugin
- [x] DataStores for local storage
- [x] Room for local database
- [x] Logging similar to Android Logger
- [x] Platform Class to check platform specific things like os version etc

Each feature follows clean architecture data, domain & presentation layers. you can easily make changes in any layer, for example for analytics it uses mixpanel if you want to swap it with posthog you can do it by just changing the analytics data source.

## Why i made this?

I was tired of writing same code in all of my KMP projects. so i decided to make a boilerplate which will help me to set up my project quickly and focus on building what truly matters. I didn't had any plan to make it open source but then i thought why not share it with the community. there are few templates available but they are paid costing around 100$ and i thought it's too much for a starter template. so i decided to make a free and open source starter template.
